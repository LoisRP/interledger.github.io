          <p class="intro">Developers, check out our <a href="/tutorials/">tutorials collection</a> to understand how Interledger works under the hood.</p>

          <h2>Sending Your First Interledger Payment</h2>

          <p class="intro">Sign up for the demo wallets and start sending Interledger payments between them in under 3 minutes.</p>

          <p>First, create an account on the <a target="_blank" href="https://red.ilpdemo.org">Red Demo Wallet</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://blue.ilpdemo.org">Blue Demo Wallet</a> (one for sending and the other for receiving).</p>

          <div>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/demo_register.png" />
          </div>

          <p>Now you can send payments between your accounts.</p>

          <div>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/demo_send.png" />
          </div>

          <p>And they arrive instantly, even though they are on different ledgers.</p>

          <div>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/demo_receive.png" />
          </div>

          <p>Congratulations, you've sent your first Interledger payment!</p>
